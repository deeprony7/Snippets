To set variable only for current shell:

VARNAME="my value"
To set it for current shell and all processes started from current shell:

export VARNAME="my value"      # shorter, less portable version
To set it permanently for all future bash sessions add such line to your .bashrc file in your $HOME directory.

To set it permanently, and system wide (all users, all processes) add set variable in /etc/environment:

sudo -H gedit /etc/environment
This file only accepts variable assignments like:

VARNAME="my value"
Do not use the export keyword here.

You need to logout from current user and login again so environment variables changes take place.

import os

# Set environment variables
os.environ['API_USER'] = 'username'
os.environ['API_PASSWORD'] = 'secret'

# Get environment variables
USER = os.getenv('API_USER')
PASSWORD = os.environ.get('API_PASSWORD')

# Getting non-existent keys
FOO = os.getenv('FOO') # None
BAR = os.environ.get('BAR') # None
BAZ = os.environ['BAZ'] # KeyError: key does not exist.
